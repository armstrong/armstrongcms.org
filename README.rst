The Django project for armstrongcms.org


Usage
-----
This is here for learning, so you shouldn't really use it.

If you do have permission to push code, you'll need to create an
``armstrong_website.settings.private`` module with the following values in it:

::

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "The Armstrong Key Here"
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "The Armstrong Secret Here"
    BCC_EMAIL = "private CRM email here"

If you need any of these, feel free to ask in the IRC channel.
